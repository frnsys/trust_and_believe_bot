"bot populism" - something about how populism is based on the (perceived) support of many individuals...how, prior to social media, was this wide support conveyed and indirectly experienced? I wonder if there have been any other historical examples of "virtual" populism (e.g. a conspiracy of newspapers trying to make it look like popular support exists for a candidate or policy when it does not). Linking it to the marketing practice of "astroturfing" and now "cognitive hacking" (which is the equivalent of astroturfing but applied to politics). bots used in this way construct a virtual social reality, which contributes to tl√∂n politics.
